py-hopscotch-dict
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mischif/py-hopscotch-dict.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mischif/py-hopscotch-dict)

A pure-Python replacement for the standard `dict` using hopscotch hashing. Hopscotch hashing guarantees O(1) worst-case lookup, as opposed to the standard `dict` which can be O(n) in the worst case.
